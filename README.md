## Gameplay

Player has four possible moves accessible as buttons visible on the screen.
Each move generates a platform with one or more valid moves.

After starting the game, a bar will appear at the top of the screen indicating the player's health, which slowly depletes over time.
Every wrong move lowers player's health by a significant amount.
Correct moves restore the player's health.

As the game goes on the difficulty will increase:
* Faster depleting health
* More disorientating camera rotations
* Less valid exits on newly generated platforms
